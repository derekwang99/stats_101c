# stats_101c
Contains my final project for Stats 101C -- Introduction to Statistical Models and Data Mining.

The focus of the project was to build a powerful model that predicts the growth of a Youtube channel.

The dataset had 7243 rows and 260 columns. 

Our final model was a bagged model (bootstrap + aggregating) with 500 trees. The model's variables were found by bagging to determine variable importance.
